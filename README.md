# NetHSM Command Line Interface

This is a command line interface for the Nitrokey NetyHSM. Note that this is:

- A third party effort that is not affiliated with Nitrokey
- A work in progress

I'm doing this in my spare time so progress may be somewhat irregular.

## Dependencies

This makes use of the generated API client <https://github.com/borud/nethsm>.
